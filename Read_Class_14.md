# How to Remove Malware from Your Windows PC

Is your PC running slower-than-usual, having pop-ups, and other anomalous issues?  Might be Malware.  It could be hardware issues, but the first thing you should do is make sure that it's not a virus, spyware or other such entity.  This includes those that have an antivirus program installed.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Removing Malware

#### Step 1: Enter Safe Mode

Before anything, disconnect the PC from the internet and stop using it until you’re ready to go through your PC and clean it up. If during this process you discover a virus or think you have one, boot into Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, only the minimum required programs and services are loaded.  The virus can prevent this on startup. This makes it easy to remove any unwanted software, because they won’t actually be running.  To boot into Safe Mode in Windows 10, first click the Start button, select the Power button, hold down the Shift key and click Reboot.  When the menu screen loads up, select Troubleshooting, Advanced Options and then Startup Settings.  Then you will have to select Restart on the next window.  Next you will see a menu with startup options; select 4 (Safe Mode).

#### Delete Temp. Files

Now in Safe Mode, first delete temporary files.  Then you’d want to run a virus scan. Disk Cleanup is a good tool for this.

#### Run Malware Scanners

After that, you’d want to run Malware scanners.  There are two types of antivirus.  Realtime which scan while in use and then on demand which you can run and check infected drives.

#### Fix Web Browser
Next you’d want to fix your web browser. Before launching, you’d want to check settings

#### Recover if Necessary

And last you’d want to recover any files if Windows is corrupt.  From here it is good practice to keep a clean “healthy” PC.
