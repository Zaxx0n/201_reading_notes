#  **Dev Tools**

Today’s reading is on “Dev Tools”, short for Web development tools.  According to Wikipedia, “Web development tools allow web developers to test and debug their code.” 

GitHub Docs
In 102, we created Github accounts.  It is my understanding that GitHub is a website that allows developers to share their code.  Pretty much social media for coders.  There weren’t really any instructions on what we should be reading, so I just started from the top where there was a “Quickstart” button that linked to a page that looks like an introduction to using GitHub.  From there I just started from the top, a link titled, nevermind… looks like I was reading the wrong part.  I went back and clicked on the “Getting started with your GitHub account”, link. This section is broken up into 6 parts.  The first is about configuring our accounts.
