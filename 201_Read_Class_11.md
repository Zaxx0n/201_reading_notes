# SSD Data Recovery

The first article in today’s reading assignment was on SSDs troubleshooting. Some of the most common indicators that your SSD may be experiencing issues are:

**Bad Blocks:** this is a form of flawed memory.  You can run software to check for physical defects.  If they are found, you should replace the SSD.

**File system repair:** This could be an issue with the connector port.  First you should backup the files and then run software to assess the performance and health of the SSD.  if necessary, you might need to reinstall the OS and format the drive.

**Read-only mode:** not very common.  If you can’t get it out of this mode, it may be that the drive is corrupted.  Save important data and continue troubleshooting.

Some other considerations for a failing SSD are:

Formatting the drive and redownloading the OS.

Power cycling the SSD

Idling in the boot menu

Updating the SSD firmware

Updating the Drivers

Though it can be difficult to recover lost data on an SD, with the right tools it may be possible. In the end it is important to have a good backup strategy.

# DBAN

The next article is on using DBAN.  We actually did this in our lab today. 
### How to Erase a Hard Drive Using Dban.
Download the DBAN program.
Save the DBAN ISO file to your computer.
Burn DBAN to a disc or USB device
Restart and boot into DBAN
Choose an option from the DBAN main menu.
Select the drive you want to delete and press F10

Make sure to carefully chose the disk you want to be erasing.  You wouldn’t want to erase the wrong drive, this would make things a bit complicated… okay, a lot.
