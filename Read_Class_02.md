#  **Dev Tools**

Today’s reading is on “Dev Tools”, short for Web development tools.  According to Wikipedia, “Web development tools allow web developers to test and debug their code.” 

### GitHub Docs
In 102, we created Github accounts.  It is my understanding that GitHub is a website that allows developers to share their code.  Pretty much social media for coders.  There weren’t really any instructions on what we should be reading, so I just started from the top where there was a “Quickstart” button that linked to a page that looks like an introduction to using GitHub.  From there I just started from the top, a link titled, nevermind… looks like I was reading the wrong part.  I went back and clicked on the “Getting started with your GitHub account”, link. This section is broken up into 6 parts.  The first is about configuring our accounts.

This was a good review of what we did setting up our GitHub accounts.  I saw that it recommends two-factor authentication, which I had yet to do.  

The article continues to explain how to interact with GitHub.

### Visual Studio Code
The second article is on Visual Studio Code.  It mentions that VS Code is a cross platform program that can run on macOS, Linux and Windows.

The updates for VS Code are monthy and those include new features and also bux fixes. It then tells you how you'd go about updating VS Code. Since I'll mainly be using it on Windows, I'm guessing, I'll look out for the auto update.

The Lab today had a lot of VS Code in it.  And I feel that it was quite the crash coarse on VS Code.
