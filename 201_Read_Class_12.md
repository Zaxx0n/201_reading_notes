# pfSense

pfSense is an open source firewall and router.  It’s free.  It’s a customized distribution of [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).  pfSense was created in 2004 as a for of m0n0wall.  The main difference between the two is that pfSense is designed mainly to be installed on a PC instead embedded devices.  This offers more flexibility and features.

### **Why Use pfSense Instead of a Router**

It’s fast, free and stable along with offering lots of features.  It gives complete control of the hardware.  It allows you to customize your system with the components you would want in a router.

It can also be installed on several different embedded platforms.  These installs are nice if you want a small, quiet, low power appliance to run your network.

There is a great community built around pfSense that offers support and documentation.
