# Windows Defender!!

Windows Defender is a security feature that comes with Windows 10 and 11.  
Without installing a 3rd party Anti-Virus, this will be your first line of defense against malicious software and other nefarious actors. It does have built in functionality to work with 3rd Party AV if desired, which I think is nice.

Defender can also serve as parental controls.  You could go in and create blocks on all sorts of web traffic, "No more Fortnite, kiddo!".  

This service does not require installation or a paid subscription, making it easy to use without much fiddling around. It doesn't have premium security features kept behind some sort of "paywall".  

Since 10 v1709, you can use Controlled Folder Access to protect data against ransomware attacks.  

If there is an issue that requires your attention, you will see a yellow exclamation mark down below in the taskbar. 

There are extensive Firewall settings that can be set up, as was demonstrated in the Lecture and also a part of our Lab assignment. 

I would imagine that this will be a large part of keeping networks secure in certain fields of cybersecurity.
