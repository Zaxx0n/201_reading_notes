# SOP
“A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task.”

SOPs are a way to implement or enforce a policy. They can be difficult to write, because there are no rules for writing them. The formats can change from organization to organization. Also, they seem to become out of date quickly if they are not maintained.  If they are not maintained, they can become obsolete.

SOPs must be: Readable, Consumable, Understandable, Actionable and Measurable. 

Make sure that when writing and SOP, you have a plan.  Maybe use a flowchart to map the activities from beginning to end. Then, combine any closely-related topics.  This will make the SOP more concise and readable.  Make sure that there is balance when it comes to the number of activities in the SOP.  Without enough detail, the SOP is basically useless. Too little, bad… too much, also bad. 

### Five Guiding Principles for Writing a SOP
> Keep it simple

> SOPs must be portable

> Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story

> Consistency counts

> It’s about the audience
