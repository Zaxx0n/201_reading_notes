# Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles
Help Desk

My understanding of Help Desk, before the reading, is that it’s the first job of many professionals in cybersecurity.    

It “includes all of the personnel that work directly with users and customers and all personnel that are working behind the scenes…” 

We’ve probably all already interacted with a “Help Desk” worker.  I’m trying to think of the last time I did.. Moving on.

I would imagine that you need a lot of patience to be a Help Desk Professional.

“Hard skills are specific, measurable skills such as configuring and troubleshooting systems. Soft skills refer to the ability to communicate effectively with others.”
I think of the term “Soft” here.  I wonder if it’s related to having a soft heart.  Being kind.  Kindness and the ability to understand that the person you are talking to as a Help Desk Professional,
The article goes on to say, “Nearly one-half (49%) believe 2013 college graduates are lacking the knowledge/basic skill of writing in English.”  This was almost 10 years ago.  My guess is that this number has only gotten worse.  I hope not, but maybe that reflects my concern about education in the US. 
Hard skills are something you can learn.  How to fix a problem on a computer for example.  I feel that it’s harder to learn “Soft skills”.
