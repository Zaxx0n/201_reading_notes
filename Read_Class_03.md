# Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles
### **Help Desk**

My understanding of Help Desk, before the reading, is that it’s the first job of many professionals in cybersecurity.    

It *“includes all of the personnel that work directly with users and customers and all personnel that are working behind the scenes…”* 

We’ve probably all already interacted with a “Help Desk” worker.  I’m trying to think of the last time I did.. Moving on.

I would imagine that you need a lot of patience to be a Help Desk Professional.

*“Hard skills are specific, measurable skills such as configuring and troubleshooting systems. Soft skills refer to the ability to communicate effectively with others.”*

I think of the term “Soft” here.  I wonder if it’s related to having a soft heart.  Being kind.  Kindness and the ability to understand that the person you are talking to as a Help Desk Professional, might be in a difficult point in their life.

The article goes on to say, “Nearly one-half (49%) believe 2013 college graduates are lacking the knowledge/basic skill of writing in English.”  This was almost 10 years ago.  My guess is that this number has only gotten worse.  I hope not, but maybe that reflects my concern about education in the US. 

Hard skills are something you can learn.  How to fix a problem on a computer for example.  I feel that it’s harder to learn “Soft skills”.
