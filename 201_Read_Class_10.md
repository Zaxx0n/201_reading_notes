# Getting Started with Veeam

Veeam is a free tool for backing up virtual machines in VMware and Hyper-V environments.  

### Some of the most popular features of Veeam Backup Free Edition
> #### **VeeamZIP**  
>Creates an ad-hoc backup of a running VM, which gives you many benefits such as being able to easily copy a backup to another host without having to power off the original VM.
> - lets you create backups of running VMs.
> - only need to specify the VM you want to back up and where to save the backup
> - the back up will be compressed, taking up about half the space

> #### **Powerful and flexible restores** 
> Supports a number of recovery scenarios, including recovery of an entire VM, guest OS files and individual application items
> - restores .vmdk, .vmx, .vdh, .vhdx, .xml
> - you can restore an entire VM to the same location or to a new location
> - restore VM disks
> - restore guest OS files

>#### **Quick Migration (VMware)** 
> Migrates a live VM between hosts or datastores with minimal downtime and without requiring clusters, shared storage, or even VMware vMOtion or Storage vMotion
> - works well even in in environments with slow connections or high latency that would prevent VMware vMotion and Hyper-V Live Migration from working
