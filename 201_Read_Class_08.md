# Windows Registry
The Windows Registry is a database where Windows and many programs store their configuration settings.  This list can be edited by the user to enable hidden functions and fine tune options. The fine tuning, or tweaks are often called “registry hacks.”

Windows Registry is a collection of several databases.  They can be system-wide or just for a specific user.  

On Windows 10 and 7, the system-wide registry settings are stored in files under C:\Windows\System32\Config\, while each user has its own NTUSER.dat. 

Registry contains keys and in those, values.  Groups of the values are called “hives” because one of the developers hated bees.

It was introduced in Windows 3.1, but was only used for certain software.

Most Windows users won’t need to use the registry.  

Editing the registry isn’t dangerous if you know what you’re doing.  If you don’t know and just start deleting files, you could actually make Windows unbootable.
